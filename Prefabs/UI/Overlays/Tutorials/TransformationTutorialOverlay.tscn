Player 1: E
Player 2: O
Controller: Right action button (B)

If you defeat a monster by attacking it from its back, the chances of it getting stunned are doubled.
Flowers will always get stunned and always stun other monsters.

For now, you can only transform into flowers. Soon you'll unlock new forms!"
